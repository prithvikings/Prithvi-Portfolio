# Prithvi-Portfolio
Hi, I’m Prithvi Raj, a web developer from Patna, Bihar. 🙋‍♂️ I have learned HTML and created this simple website to showcase my portfolio. 🙌 HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it defines the structure and content of a web page. 🌐 HTML uses tags to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and more.
